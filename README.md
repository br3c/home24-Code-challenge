## Task

Write a program/script which draws a christmas tree (as [ASCII-Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)).
The program/script should take two values as input:

- number for the height of the tree
- parameter to indicate whether the tree should be    drawn with a star on top of it

## How to run the code

First, you will need Python3 on your computer.

Visit: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download for installation instructions.

After you successfully installed Python3 on your computer, you should be able to run the program as follows:

-Click the green "Code" button and download the ZIP file.

-Extract the contents of the ZIP file.

-Open a terminal in the project directory.

show the help message:

    python3 ascii_tree.py -h

print a tree with a chosen height (e.g.: 5) but without a star on top of it:

    python3 ascii_tree.py --height 5

print a tree with a chosen height and a star on top of it:

    python3 ascii_tree.py --height 5 --star
